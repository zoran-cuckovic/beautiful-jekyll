Hello!

Author/editor of LandscapeArchaeology.org goes by the name of Zoran Čučković. The site will bring together my previous work on geographical analysis and archaeology. See at [zoran-cuckovic.from.hr](http://zoran-cuckovic.from.hr). I’m currently a PhD candidate in archaeology at the University of Bourgogne Franche-Comté, France. Previously I worked as archaeologist in Croatia and studied in Croatia and Slovenia.

On Twitter, I'm [@GISwhispers](https://twitter.com/giswhisp).

LandscapeArchaeology.org is published in France and is attributed ISSN 2649-8774.
